\chapter{Historical Background}

\noindent
{\Huge T}he British came to India in 1600 as traders, in the form of East India Company, which had the exclusive right of trading in India under a chapter granted by \index{Queen Elizabeth I}Queen Elizabeth I. In 1764, the Company, which till now had purely trading functions obtained the \singleQuote{diwani}\hspace{4pt}(i.e., rights over revenue and civil justice) of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa
\endnote{The Mughal Emperor, Shah Alam, granted \singleQuote{Diwani} to the Company after its victory in the Battle of Buxar (1764)}. This started its career as a territorial power. In 1858, in the wake of the \singleQuote{Sepoy mutiny}\index{Sepoy mutiny}, the British Crown assumed direct responsibility for the governance of India. This rule continued until India was granted independence on August 15, 1947.

With Independence came the need of a Constitution. As suggested by \index{M.N. Roy}M.N. Roy (a pioneer of communist movement in India and an advocate of Radical Democrat-ism) in 1934, a Constituent Assembly was formed for this purpose in 1946 and on January 26, 1950, the Constitution and polity have their roots in the British rule. There are certain events in the British rule that laid down the legal framework for the organization and functioning of government and administration in British India. These events have greatly influenced out contribution and polity. They are explained here in a chronological order:

\section{The Company Rule (1973-1858)}

\subsection{Regulating Act of 1773}\index{Acts!Regulating Act of 1773}
This act is of great constitutional importance as (a) it was the first step taken by the British Government to control and regulate the affairs of the East India Company in India; (b) it recognized, for the first time, the political and administrative functions of the Company; and (c) it laid the foundations of central administration in India.

\paragraph{Features of the Act}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item It designated the Governor of Bengal as the \singleQuote{Governor-General of Bengal} and created an Executive Council of four members to assist him. The \textbf{first such Governor-General was Lord Warren Hastings}.
  \item It made the \textbf{governors of Bombay and Madras presidencies subordinate to the governor-general of Bengal}, unlike earlier, when the three presidencies were independent of one another.
  \item It provided for the \textbf{establishment of a Supreme Court at Calcutta (1774) comprising one chief justice and three other judges}.
  \item It \textbf{prohibited} the \textbf{servants} of the Company from \textbf{engaging in any private trade or accepting presents or bribes from the \singleQuote{natives}}.
  \item It \textbf{strengthened the control of the British Government} over the \textbf{Company} by \textbf{requiring the Court of Directors} (governing body of the Company) to \textbf{report on its revenue, civil, and military affairs in India}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Pitt's India Act of 1784}\index{Acts!Pitt's India Act of 1784}

In a bid to rectify the defects of the Regulating Act of 1773, the British Parliament passed the \index{Acts!Amending Act of 1781}Amending Act of 1781, also known as the \index{Acts!Act of Settlement}\index{Acts!Amending Act of 1781}Act of Settlement. The next important act was the Pitt's India Act of 1784.

\paragraph{Features of the Act}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It distinguished between the commercial and political functions of the company.
  \item It allowed the Court of Directors to manage the commercial affairs but created a new body called Board of Control to manage the political affairs. Thus, it established a system of double government.
  \item It employed the Board of Control to supervise and direct all operations of civil and military government or revenues of the British possessions in India.
\end{enumerate}

Thus, the act was significant for two reasons: first, the Company's territories in India were for the first time called the \singleQuote{British possessions in India}; and second, the British Government was given the supreme control over Company's affairs and its administration in India.

\subsection{Charter Act of 1833}\index{Acts!Charter Act of 1833}

This Act was the final step towards the centralization in British India.

\paragraph{Features of the Act}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It made the Governor-General of Bengal as the Governor-General of India and vested in him all civil and military powers. Thus, the act created, for the first time, a Government of India having authority over the entire territorial area possessed by the British in India. \index{Lord William Bentick!first governor-general of India}Lord William Bentick was the first governor-general of India.
  \item It deprived the governor of Bombay and Madras of their legislative powers. The Governor-General of India was given exclusive legislative powers for the entire British India. The law made under the previous acts were called as Regulation while laws made under this act were called as Acts.
  \item It ended the activities of the East India Company as a commercial body, which became a purely administrative body. It provided that the company's territories in India were held by it \singleQuote{in trust for His Majesty, His heirs and successors}.
  \item The Charter Act of 1833 attempted to introduce a system of open competition for civil servants, and stated that the Indians should not be debarred from holding any place, office and employment under the Company. However, this provision negated after opposition from the Courts of Directors.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Charter Act of 1853}\index{Acts!Charter Act of 1853}

This was the last of the series of Charter Acts passed by th British Parliament between 1793 and 1853. It was a significant constitutional landmark.
\paragraph{Features of the Act}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item It separated, for the first time, the legislative and executive functions of the Governor-General's council. It provided for the addition of six new members called the legislative councilors to the council. In other words, it established a separate Governor-General's legislative council which came to be known as the \index{Indian (Central) Legislative Council}Indian (Central) Legislative Council. This legislative wing of the council functioned as mini-Parliament, adopting the same procedures as the British Parliament. Thus, legislative, of the first time, was treated as a special function of the government, requiring special machinery and special process.
  \item It introduced an open competition system of selection and recruitment of \index{civil servants}civil servants was thus thrown open to Indians also. Accordingly, the \gls{Lord Macaulay}\index{Macaulay Committee} \gls{Macaulay Committee}Macaulay Committee (the Committee on the Indian Civil Services) was appointed in 1854.
  \item It extended the Company's rule and allowed it to retain the possession of Indian territories on trust for the British Crown. But, it did not specify any particular period, unlike the previous Charters. This was a clear indication that the Company' rule could be terminated at any time the Parliament liked.
  \item It introduced, for the first time, local representation in the Indian (Central) Legislative Council. Of the six new legislative members of the governor-general's council, four members were appointed by the local (provincial) governments of Madras, Bombay, Bengal and Agra.
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Crown Rule}

\subsection{Government of India Act of 1858}\index{Acts!Government of India Act of 1858}

This significant Act was enacted in the wake of the \index{Revolt of 1857}Revolt of 1857 - also known as the \index{Sepoy mutiny!First War of Independence}First War of Independence of the \index{Sepoy mutiny}\singleQuote{Sepoy mutiny}. The act known as the \index{Act for the Good Government of India}\textbf{Act for the Good Government of India}, abolished the East India Company, and transferred the powers of government, territories and revenues to British Crown.

\paragraph{Features of the Act}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It provided that India henceforth was to be governed by, and in the name of, Her Majesty. It changed the designation of th Governor-General of India to that of Viceroy of India. He (viceroy) was the direct representative of the British Crown in India. \index{Lord Canning!first Viceroy of India}Lord Canning thus became first Viceroy of India.
  \item It ended the system of double government by abolishing the Board of Control and Court of Directors.
  \item It created a new office, Secretary of State for India, vested with complete authority and control over Indian administration. The secretary of state was a member of the British cabinet and was responsible ultimately to the British Parliament.
  \item It established a 15-member Council of India to assist the secretary of state for India. The council was an advisory body. The secretary of state was made the chairman of the council.
  \item It constituted the secretary of state-in-council as a body corporate, capable of suing and being sued in India and in England.
\end{enumerate}

\singleQuote{The Act of 1858 was, however, largely confined to improvement of the administrative machinery by which the Indian Government was to be supervised and controlled in England. It did not alter in any substantial way the system of government that prevailed in India.}


\subsection{Indian Councils Act of 1861, 1892 and 1909}

After the great revolt of 1857, the British Government felt the necessity of seeking the cooperation of the Indians in the administration of their country. In pursaunce of this policy of association, three acts were enacted by the British Parliament in 1864, 1892 and 1909. The Indian Council Act of 1864 is an important landmark in the constitutional and political history of India.

\paragraph{Features of the Act of 1861}\index{Acts!Indian Councils Act of 1861}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It made a beginning of representative institutions by association Indians with the law-making process. It thus provided that the viceroy should nominate some Indians as non-official members of his expanded council. In 1862, \index{Lord Canning}Lord Canning, the then viceroy, nominated three Indians to his legislative council — the Raja of Benaras, the Maharaja of Patiala and \index{Dinkar Rao}Sir Dinkar Rao.
  \item It initiated the process of decentralization by restoring the legislative powers to the Bombay and Madras Presidencies. It thus reversed the centralizing tendency that started from the Regulating Act of 1773 and reached its climax under the Charter Act of 1833. This policy of legislative devolution resulted in the grant of almost complete internal autonomy to the provinces in 1937.
  \item It also provided for the establishment of new legislative councils for Bengal, \index{North-Western Frontier Province (NWFP)}North-Western Frontier Province (\gls{NWFP}) and Panjab, which were established in 1862, 1866 and 1897 respectively.
  \item It empowered the Viceroy to make rules and orders for the more convenient transaction of business in the council. It also gave a recognition to the \index{portfolio system} \singleQuote{portfolio} system, introduced by \index{Lord Canning}Lord Canning in 1859. Under this, a member of the Viceroy's council was made in-charge of one or more departments of the government and was authorized to issue final orders on behalf of the council on matters of his department(s).
  \item It empowered the Viceroy to issue ordinance, without the concurrence of the legislative council, during an \index{emergency}emergency. The life of such ordinance was six months.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Features of the Act of 1892}\index{Acts!Indian Councils Act of 1892}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It increased the number of additional (non-official) members in the Central and provincial legislative councils, but maintained the official majority in them.
  \item It increased the function of legislative councils and gave them the power of discussing the budget and addressing questions to executive.
  \item It provided for the nomination of some non-official members of the 
  \begin{list}{}{}
    \item[(a)] Central Legislative Council by the viceroy on the recommendation of the provincial legislative councils and the Bengal Chamber of Commerce,
    \item[(b)] that of the Provincial legislative councils by the Governors on the recommendation of the district boards, municipalities, universities, trade associations, zamindars and chambers.
  \end{list}
\end{enumerate}
\singleQuote{The act made a limited and indirect provision for the use of election in filling up some of the non-official seats both in the Central and provincial legislative councils. The word \doubleQuote{election} was, however not used in the act. The process was described as nomination made on the recommendation of certain bodies.}

\paragraph{Features of the Act of 1909}\index{Acts!Indian Councils Act of 1909}
This Act is also known as \index{Motley Minto Reforms}Morley-Minto Reforms (Lord Morley was the then Secretary of State for India and Lord Minto was the then Viceroy of India).
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It considerably increased the size of the legislative councils, both Central and Provincial. The number of members in the Central Legislative Council was raised from 16 to 60. The number of members in the provincial legislative councils was not uniform.
  \item It retained official majority in the Central Legislative Council but allowed the provincial legislative councils to habe non-official majority.
  \item It enlarged the deliberative functions of the legislative councils at both the levels. For example, members were allowed to ask supplementary questions, move resolutions on the budget, and so on.
  \item It provided (for the first time) for the association of Indians with the executive Councils of the Viceroy and Governors. \index{Satyendra Prasad Sinha}\gls{Satyendra Prasad Sinha}Satyendra Prasad Sinha became the first Indian to join the Viceroy's Executive Council. He was appointed as the law member.
  \item It introduced a system of communal representation for Muslims by accepting the concept of \index{separate electorate}\gls{separate electorate}\singleQuote{separate electorate}. Under this, the Muslim members were to be elected only by Muslim voter. Thus, the Act \singleQuote{legalized communal-ism} and Lord Minto came to be known as the Father of Communal Electorate.
  \item It also provided for the separate representation of presidency corporations, chambers of commerce, universities and zamindars.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Government of India Act of 1919}\index{Acts!Government of India Act of 1919}

On August 20, 1917, the British Government declared, for the first time, that its objective was the gradual introduction of responsible government in India\footnotemark.
