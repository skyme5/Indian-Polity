The Cabinet Mission consisting of three members (Lord Pethick Lawrence, Sir Stafford Cripps and A V Alexander) arrived in India on March 24, 1946. The Cabinet Mission published its plan on May 16, 1946.
These include Madras, Bombay, U P , Bihar, Central Provinces, Orissa, Punjab, NWFP, Sindh, Bengal and Assam.
These include Delhi, Ajmer–Merwara, Coorg and British Baluchistan.
The Government of India Act of 1935 granted limited franchise on the basis of tax, property and education.
These include Baroda, Bikaner, Jaipur, Patiala, Rewa and Udaipur.
For the first time, the Constituent Assembly met as Dominion Legislature on November 17, 1947 and elected G V Mavlankar as its speaker.
These are West Punjab, East Bengal, NWFP, Sindh, Baluchistan and Sylhet District of Assam. A separate Constituent Assembly was set up for Pakistan.
The Provisional Parliament ceased to exist on April 17, 1952. The first elected Parliament with the two Houses came into being in May 1952.
One of the political consequences of the British Government’s statement of June 3, 1947, was that following a referendum, the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan became part of the territory of the Dominion of Pakistan and as a result the tribal areas in this region became a concern of that Dominion. The Sub-Committee on the Tribal Areas in the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan was not therefore called upon to function on behalf of the Constituent Assembly of India. (B. Shiva Rao, The Framing of India’s Constitution : Select Documents, Volume III, P.681.) The members of this Sub-Committee were : Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Khan Abdul Samad Khan and Mehr Chand Khanna. The information about the Chairman is not found.
