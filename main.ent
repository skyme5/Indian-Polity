Pandit
Nehru
said
in

thus:
‘We
took
pledge
long
ago
to
achieve
Purna
Swaraj.
We
have
achieved
it.
Does
a
nation
lose
its
independence
by
an
alliance
with
another
country?
Alliance
normally
means
commitments.
The
free
association
of
the
sovereign
Commonwealth
of
Nations
does
not
involve
such
commitments.
Its
very
strength
lies
in
its
flexibility
and
its
complete
freedom.
It
is
well-known
that
it
is
open
to
any
member-nation
to
go
out
of
the
commonwealth
if
it
so
chooses’.

further
stated,
‘It
is
an
agreement
by
free
will,
to
be
terminated
by
free
will’.
